# # Programming in Python
# ## Exam: June 21, 2023
#
# You can solve the exercises below by using standard Python 3.10 libraries, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, PyMC.
# You can browse the documentation: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.10/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html), [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io).
# You can also look at the [slides of the course](https://homes.di.unimi.it/monga/lucidi2223/pyqb00.pdf) or your code on [GitHub](https://github.com).

# ### Exercise 1 (max 4 points)
#
# The file [rhinos.csv](./rhinos.csv) (Duth√©, Vanessa (2023), Reductions in home-range size and social interactions among dehorned black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis), Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gf1vhhmt5) contains:
#
# - Date: date of rhino sighting
# - RhinosAtSighting: id of individual rhino
# - Sex: sex of individual rhino
# - Horn: indicating horned or dehorned rhino at time of sighting
# - DateBorn: date of birth of individual rhino
# - Reserve: reserve where sighting occured
#
# Read the data in a pandas DataFrame. Be sure  that the columns `Date` and `DateBorn` has dtype `pd.datetime64[ns]`.
#

pass

# ### Exercise 2 (max 4 points)
#
# Add a column `Age` with the age in years of the rhinos at the time of the sighting.
#

pass

# ### Exercise 3 (max 7 points)
#
# Define a function `dehorn_trend` that takes a list of pairs (a, b), where a is a date (a `pd.datetime64[ns]`) and b is a boolean value, denoting if a rhino was dehorned (`True`) or horned (`False`); the function returns the list of the pairs in which the horned/dehorned state changed. For example, if the input list is `[(pd.to_datetime('1.1.1989'), True), (pd.to_datetime('1.1.1990'), False), (pd.to_datetime('1.1.1995'), False)]`, the function should return `[(pd.to_datetime('1.1.1989'), True), (pd.to_datetime('1.1.1995'), False)]`; in other words, when in a sequence of pairs the right side has the same value, you should keep only the last pair. You can assume the pairs are ordered by increasing date.
#
# To get the full marks, you should declare correctly the type hints and add a test within a doctest string.

pass

# ### Exercise 4 (max 4 points)
#
# Apply the function defined in Exercise 3 to the data referring to rhino MPGRBF-02-05.

pass

# ### Exercise 5 (max 2 points)
#
# Compute the ratio dehorned/(all individual sightings) for each rhino

pass

# ### Exercise 6 (max 3 points)
#
# Plot a histogram of the number of rhinos observed in each reserve

pass

# ### Exercise 7 (max 3 points)
#
# Plot together the histograms of the number of male and female rhinos observed in each reserve

pass

# ### Exercise 8 (max 6 points)
#
# Consider this statistical model:
#
# - a parameter $\alpha$ is uniformly distributed between 1 and 50
# - $\sigma$ is exponentially distributed with $\lambda = 1$
# - the observed `age` is normally distributed with a standard deviation of $\sigma$ and a mean given by $\alpha$.
#
# Code this model with pymc, sample the model, and plot the summary of the resulting estimation by using `az.plot_posterior`.
